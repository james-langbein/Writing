# The Characteristics of Idols
## Introduction
This study is intended to be a concise overview of what an idol is. It is meant to aid in understanding them and identifying them in your own life. I pray that as you read this the Holy Spirit would you convict you of idols in your own life. If you are convicted as you are reading, I would urge you not to keep reading but rather pray right there and then or write it down and commit to looking at it when you're done. Your flesh will want to avoid removing idols because the flesh depends on them for life.

An idol is anything that takes God's place in our life in terms of worship. The definition of worship is "the feeling or expression of reverence and adoration for a deity". Worship becomes evident in how we use our time, what we give attention to, how we approach decision-making and what we prioritise - in essence, our **values**.

God has given us specific commands about worship. Idolatry is a twisting of those commands. The first two of the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:3-6) directly address idolatry, indicating how seriously God regards it.
- “You shall have no other gods before me."
- “You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments."

God has also given us a physical example in the Old Testament of what must be done with idols. Namely, the idol must be broken or destroyed, and it's place as well.

Idols have an intrinsic relationship to temples, altars, and sacrifices. While I will go into this, it is not a shallow subject and much study could go into it. I will have to keep details brief so that the study isn't too long.

The following is a list of the characteristics of idols, with a comparison to God's characteristics. I've provided the comparison as it is often easier to define something when we know what *it is not*, or what it is *the opposite of*. Below the list, I will go into a little more detail on each of them.

## Characteristics
### Created
An idol can be anything other than God. It can be something created by God or man.
### Outside of us
The idol is outside of us, as opposed to how God lives inside of us through the Holy Spirit.
### Has a temple
A temple is a place of worship. An idol will typically have a *place* where it is worshiped.
### Has an altar
An altar is in a temple, and is where sacrifices are directly offered. Another way to say this is that it is the *vehicle* by which the sacrifices are given. Our heart is the altar of worship, so whatever comes before God in our heart will be (or will become) an idol.
### Visible/Physical Representation
It will always be visible in some way, or if it is not directly visible it will have a physical representation. It is important to note that the altar of God has no physical representation of Him on it, it is *physically empty* but *spiritually occupied* by Him.
### Has a sacrifice
A sacrifice is something that is of cost to us. The cost can be summed up as something that requires time, space, energy and attention. This could be the time taken to go a physical temple where energy and attention are given to a physical statue, or it could be time taken on a couch where energy and attention are given to our phone.
### False provision
The sacrifice to the idol is given in return for provision. This provision could be something we expect to receive in the future, such as a person sacrificing to a physical idol for a good harvest. Or the provision is something more direct and in the moment, such as a false peace given by distracting ourselves from boredom or hurt.
### Transactional
The provision given by the idol is **only in return** for the sacrifice. The idol can not and will not give this provision without first being given something. The idol does not have grace or mercy as God does - who gives without requiring something from us first.
### Faith not required
An idol does not require faith due to being visible. We have immediate access to it, and often it is used to gain an immediate response in terms of our emotions. Thus, we do not need to have faith that it will provide at some unknown point.
### Many
There are many possible idols, with no limit to the number. This is seen directly in that false religions will have more than one God.
### Related to Force
Idols are related to forces and power, the ability to manipulate reality. They provide apparent power, security, control and influence.
### Give life to our flesh
Our flesh is given life by sacrificing to idols. An example could be where we have a resentment towards someone, where we are holding onto self-pity (pride) for being a victim... and the sacrifice that provides false peace and distraction from the hurt, numbing our senses by food/gaming etc, allows us to ignore it and not deal with it by God's grace with forgiveness.
### Enslaves us
Ultimately, all idols are things that enslave us rather than free us. We sacrifice to them to gain freedom from *something* outside of ourselves - such as bad weather, boredom, hurt or other people's control and influence. But this provision is only temporary. It leads down a spiralling path of further sacrifice to gain more provision.
## The Result of Idolatry
The result of giving worship to idols is that ultimately we ourselves become a dying sacrifice on the altar of worship to Satan - the false god. This is in contrast to giving ourselves as living sacrifices as intended by God. The more that we sacrifice to idols the harder it will be to put our flesh to death as commanded by God.
## God's Characteristics
All of the previously mentioned characteristics of idols can be seen as twisting elements of the story of redemption by Christ. Christ became the ultimate sacrifice for all. The **single invisible creator**, **God of everything**, who is **spirit**, **frees us** by becoming the **sacrifice** himself, when we had **nothing to give**, and then comes to **live inside of us**, making us the **temple**, the **altar**, and a **living sacrifice** by our **relationship** to him, in **faith**, **providing** life in abundance. Jesus Christ is the ultimate and final representation of what is necessary. In fact, we simply participate ***in his Body*** as living sacrifices ourselves - we cannot give a worthy sacrifice apart from him - and it is he that truly gives the sacrifice to God.
## Where Are Idols In Your Life?
I trust that the Holy Spirit may have already brought to your mind one or more examples of idols in your own life, but if not, I invite you to prayerfully consider where they might be. It may be that you can't think of any, in which case I would urge you first to pray for humility.

Examining the *why* behind the things you do is a very good way to uncover idols. Our motivations come from our heart. It is not necessarily the things we do that are evil. For example, eating is not wrong in itself. But it is the *why* that will give light to where our flesh is alive and well. Eating for gluttony to numb ourselves is certainly wrong.

Remember that a person cannot serve two masters. God will not share his glory with another. We cannot have idols alongside God on the altar of our heart.

We cannot truly see God, and therefore see what is not him, without humility. It is by God's grace that we can get rid of our idols with his help, and God gives grace to the humble. Jesus Christ's ultimate example was that he *humbled* himself unto *death*. We are called to follow his example and *put our flesh to death* and instead live our lives in obedience to the Spirit.
