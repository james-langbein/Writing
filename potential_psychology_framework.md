# A Potential Psychology Framework
With what I've been studying lately in terms of myself, my parents and conversation in the last couple of days with Kelsey - looking at the similarities and differences between NPD and APD, I've been wondering about the core underpinning framework/s of psychology.

There isn't any recognised 'base' framework. But it doesn't seem impossible that there could be one, however nuanced it might be. So I've thought I might try and see what I can come up with.

The first thought I have is that it must be related to intimacy. The first fact is existence, the second is communication, and the third is relationship. This forms the basis of intimacy, the core structure and behaviour of relationships.

A relationship can be defined as any time an entity's behaviour (i.e. affective communication) or communication (not directly affective, need to come up with a word for this) is apprehended by (i.e. affected by, observed) another entity. This exists on a scale from none through to completely connected. The level of effect is defined as the [[influence]]. We can be in relationship to many different things, both animate and inanimate, with different levels of influence in different relationships.

As mentioned above, there are three things - [[existence]], [[communication]] and [[relationship]], and in that order they affect each other. The **state** of the existing entity will affect its communication, and thus the nature of the communication will affect the relationship. The first thought here is that **existence** is primarily about **state**. Existence itself has a **fractal nature** in terms of intimacy, with an internal system of parts that are in relationship. But it is still primarily about state.
The first dimension I can think of in terms of **identity** is [[Coherence|coherence]], or orderliness. Identity by its nature is ordered, but an entity can have some level of disorder while still maintaining some level of distinctness. Too much disorder (i.e. chaotic or destructive tendencies, either inwardly or outwardly directed) and an entity begins to lose stability.
The second dimension I can think of is **boundary**. This is probably related to orderliness. Boundary is the clarity of distinction from other entities. A breakdown in the boundary and the entity begins to lose distinctness from others, and therefore proportionally loses identity, since identity has a primary quality of distinctness. This dimension might be seen in qualities like **enmeshment**.
(Any further dimensions?)

One key aspect for **people** is that as sentient beings they get some level of choice in their identity and behaviour, it appears that we have free will. So, we get to decide, in some sense, our coherence and boundaries. (In a deep way, we also don't get to choose, but there is a dynamic at work here...)
The idea of **self-actualisation** is seen in this aspect.

(One thing to note while I'm thinking about it - just because something isn't measurable doesn't mean it's not real. Existence cannot be measured, and communication is too complex to measure in a real moment-to-moment sense, but the end result of relationship is still visible and real.)

(The other thing to note - I don't think this model is untrue, I'm fairly sure that someone educated in psychology would see validity in this model.. where the differences arise are the determination of what is moral/ethical...)

(Another thing to note - the qualities of identity have a direct effect on communication, so the quality of coherence of identity will have a direct secondary effect on the coherence of its communication.)
